This project encapsulates the development and evaluation of an Academic Support System
designed to improve accessibility for students, particularly those with disabilities and
international students. The system leverages advanced technologies, including Artificial
Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), centred around a robust
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model developed using the Kaldi toolkit. This model is
integral to the system's capability to offer real-time lecture transcription, which enables all
students to access and engage with lecture content more effectively. The necessity for this
system stems from the challenges that traditional learning materials present to students who
face barriers due to physical disabilities or language differences. By transforming spoken
lectures into text in real-time, the system not only aids in comprehension during lectures but
also enhances students' ability to review and interact with educational content at their own
pace. Significant efforts were put into ensuring that the system is user-friendly and
integrative, employing the MERN stack to create a seamless digital platform for users. This
platform supports the ASR tool and simplifies access to educational materials,
demonstrating a potentially significant impact on educational outcomes across a diverse
student
